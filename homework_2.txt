Homework 2:
What do these transactions do?

Transaction date/time: Jun-21-2016 07:49:13 PM at Block number: 1746429 
..... This is the DAO attack?????

What is it? : A contract that caused repetition of 2 transfers... although I cant tell exactly how it was done, it has the following.... 
Repeated 31 times... 
TRANSFER  429.880658058073402535 Ether From TheDAO Token To  0xf4c64518ea10f995918a454158c6b61407ea345c
TRANSFER  0.000001497161439856 Ether From DaoManagedAcct To  0xe306aac52823ba1d3938608381a2444d9d641cc1
... times 31! Thats 430*31 = 13,330ETH 
And then, 31 times....
Token transfers of $3,505,198.99 31 times too, which is $1.1bn!! From 0xe306aac52823ba1d3938608381a2444d9d641cc1 to Black Hole: 0x000â€¦000!

The transaction fee here is 0.1ETH? This seems enormous (500 bucks at the time)... it looks like a contract deployment - it has no 'value' 
The contract itself is a uniswap, so is this people buying or selling tokens of some denomination - its swapping ETH for tokens so I assume its buying tokens, perhaps this was an IPO? Its most recent transactions are seconds ago!

Im not sure what 'PolyNetwork Exploiter 1' is? ---- https://cointelegraph.com/news/poly-network-hacker-returns-258m-conducts-ama-on-how-it-went-down
It looks like the Polygon network had some  serious security issues and this guy (who had a right ballsy AMA after) was going to give a lot of it back! You see the poly guys begging for it to be put back which just shows how hard it would be for them to get it back! 

So, this is a hack. Fine. I don't know the details of what the security issue is though? Im not sure how to find out what the vulnerability is?

This looks like the guy paying them back! 96,942,062.85 DAI Stablecoin, so i think its the same amount of dollars according to the etherscan? Wow. And the wasnt all of it either hahah!

This is a transfer of 160ETH (509,440USD) to the Hacker? Are they paying them cash to get them to return tokens? The gas is pretty low so i assume this is just a transfer and nothing more complex. Im not sure why anyone is paying a hacker, or are they employing them?! 


What is the largest account balance you can find ?

Add: 0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa
Name: Eth2 Deposit Contract	
Bal: 8,215,410.000069 Ether	
% total currency: 6.97524723%	
# Transactions: 163,378 --- but this looks like some kind of contract that is used to sell it, so maybe this isnt a person... 

The first one that doesnt have a name is: 	
Add: 0x73bceb1cd57c711feac4224d062b0f6ff338501e
Balance: 1,859,792.47052129 Ether	
% total currency1.57904624%
# transactions: 342 ---> suspect that this is some sort of investor maybe, but thats a LOT of ETH?! 

The exchange sites like Binance, Kraken have huge balances, but these are companies with which you can have a wallet etc, so I guess this is just their working capital of everyones wallets? Also notice that there are a LOT of accounts that have exactly 150,000 ETH each, all with about 4/5 transactions, is this a coincidence? 

What is special about these accounts :
1. 0x1db3439a222c519ab44bb1144fc28167b4fa6ee6 - balance is 382ETH, it says Eth2 depositor
People seem to think this is Vitalik Buterin, and are literally just begging for money... 'im so poor and desperate I cant feed my family' etc.... seriously?!

2. 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD - this is the black hole address from the hack above isnt it?? transactions up to like 9 hours ago? balance 12,552 ETH, hundreds of transactions. There is a forum thread on it saying its an ETH burning account, but then others saying 'send in what you can afford' ... theyre funding something?
